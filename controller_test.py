# Assignment 2 - Test Runner for the Controller
#
# CSC148 Summer 2017, University of Toronto
#
# ***IMPORTANT NOTE***
# Because you have some flexibility in how the controller behaves
# (e.g., the exact messages which are displayed to the user),
# we will not be grading the output of the controller automatically.
#
# Instead, what we provide here is a structured way to feed
# the controller certain instructions, and save the output to a file.
# Your TAs will be reading these outputs and assessing their
# correctness.
# We have given one example in the 'main' block below.
# We encourage you to make your own tests, and
# you may share the outputs of these tests with your classmates.
